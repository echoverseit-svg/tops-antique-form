# 🚀 Final Steps to Deploy Email System

## ✅ Nodemailer Installed!

Now you need to push to GitHub and redeploy to Vercel.

---

## 📋 **Run These Commands:**

### **Step 1: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add email functionality with nodemailer"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Vercel Will Auto-Deploy**
- Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check the "Deployments" tab in Vercel dashboard

---

## ⏱️ **After Deployment (Wait 2-3 mins)**

1. Go to your Vercel URL: `topsantique.vercel.app`
2. Login to `/admin`
3. Try sending an email again
4. ✅ Should work now!

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong?**

❌ **Problem:** `nodemailer` package wasn't installed  
✅ **Solution:** Ran `npm install nodemailer`  
⚠️ **Next:** Push to GitHub so Vercel also installs it  

---

## ✅ **Checklist**

- [x] Nodemailer installed locally
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel auto-deploys (wait 2-3 mins)
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] Test email sending

**Run the git commands above now!** 🚀
